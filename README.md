# Data Cleaning and Transformation with pandas

## Introduction

This project demonstrates the use of the pandas library for data cleaning and transformation. pandas is a Python library designed for data manipulation and analysis. It is widely used in data science and machine learning workflows due to its flexibility and ease of use.

This README serves as both documentation for the project and a set of "class notes" to explain the underlying concepts, demonstrating an understanding of data cleaning and transformation principles.

## What This Project Does

1. **Data Cleaning**:

   - Handles missing data by removing rows with null values.
   - Ensures data consistency by converting data types (e.g., converting ages to integers).
   - Removes duplicate rows to avoid redundancy.

2. **Data Transformation**:
   - Groups data by a specified column (e.g., grouping by country) and calculates statistics (e.g., mean age).
   - Pivots data to restructure it into a new format, making it easier to analyze.

## Project Files

### `main.py`

The entry point of the project. This file:

- Loads sample data into a pandas DataFrame.
- Cleans the data by calling functions from `data_cleaning.py`.
- Transforms the cleaned data using functions from `data_transformation.py`.
- Outputs the results to the console.

### `data_cleaning.py`

This module contains functions for data cleaning. Key concepts demonstrated:

- **Removing Missing Values**: Uses the `dropna()` method to exclude rows with missing data.
- **Converting Data Types**: Uses `astype()` to enforce consistent data types.
- **Removing Duplicates**: Uses `drop_duplicates()` to remove redundant rows.

### `data_transformation.py`

This module contains functions for data transformation. Key concepts include:

- **Grouping Data**: Uses the `groupby()` method to group rows by a specified column and calculate aggregate statistics (e.g., mean).
- **Pivoting Data**: Uses `pivot_table()` to restructure the DataFrame into a new, more analyzable format.

### `requirements.txt`

Lists the required Python libraries to run this project (e.g., pandas, NumPy).

### `README.md`

This file, serving as project documentation and conceptual notes.

## Concepts Explained

### **1. Data Cleaning**

#### **Why Clean Data?**

Data in real-world scenarios is often messy, containing missing values, inconsistent types, or duplicates. Cleaning ensures the dataset is accurate and ready for analysis.

#### **Methods Used**

1. **Removing Missing Values (`dropna`)**:

   - Missing values can skew analysis or cause errors in calculations.
   - Example:
     ```python
     df = df.dropna()
     ```

2. **Converting Data Types (`astype`)**:

   - Ensures data is in the expected format (e.g., integers, floats, strings).
   - Example:
     ```python
     df['Age'] = df['Age'].astype(int)
     ```

3. **Removing Duplicates (`drop_duplicates`)**:
   - Eliminates redundant rows to maintain unique records.
   - Example:
     ```python
     df = df.drop_duplicates()
     ```

### **2. Data Transformation**

#### **Why Transform Data?**

Transformation reshapes the data into a format that is easier to analyze or better suited for specific analyses.

#### **Methods Used**

1. **Grouping Data (`groupby`)**:

   - Groups rows by one or more columns and computes aggregate statistics (e.g., sum, mean).
   - Example:
     ```python
     grouped_df = df.groupby('Country')['Age'].mean()
     ```

2. **Pivoting Data (`pivot_table`)**:
   - Restructures the data into a table format, where columns and rows represent key variables.
   - Example:
     ```python
     pivoted_df = df.pivot_table(index='Country', values='Age', aggfunc='mean')
     ```

## How to Run This Project

1. **Set Up the Environment**:

   - Activate the virtual environment:
     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows
     source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
     ```
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

2. **Run the Script**:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

3. **Observe the Output**:
   - The original, cleaned, grouped, and pivoted data will be displayed in the terminal.
